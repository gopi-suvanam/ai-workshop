The code here contains:
1. Linear regression model for predicting sequences
2. Deep learning model for generating music

These notebooks can be run on local machine or Google colab. For running in colab the files and data has to be transfered to the cloud. 

To run the music generation note book you need:
1. music21 library
2. pandas library
3. numpy library
4. tensorflow

Download midi files of music for training the model (for example from here: https://bitmidi.com/). Store them in a folder called music/ in the main folder from where the notebook is started.
The output will be in the file call AI_music.mid.
